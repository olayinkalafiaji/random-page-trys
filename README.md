            The Swan is a large waterfowl in the Anatidae family. These birds
            are generally quite large, with long curved necks. They share a
            family with the smaller ducks and geese, though they are more
            closely related to geese than they are to ducks.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are six different species of Swans including the
            <b>mute Swan</b>, <b>Tundra Swan</b>, <b>Black Swan</b>,
            <b>Trumpeter Swan</b>, <b>Black-Necked Swan</b>, and the
            <b>Whooper Swan</b>. Read on to learn about the Swan.

          <h3>Interesting Facts About the Swan</h3>
          <p>

            these unique birds below.

              <b>Battering Bird </b>– A pair of nesting Swans is not something
              you want to contend with! Some species are more territorial and
              aggressive than others, but all species protect their young. These
              defensive birds rush at a potential threat and batter it with
              their wings or bite with their beaks.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Ugly Duckling</b> – Baby Swans, known as “cygnets,” are not
              born white. Most white species of are born gray, and they become
              white as they age.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Monogamous Mates</b> – Like many ducks and geese, Swans usually
              mate for life. A pair of these beautiful birds bonds strongly, and
              continues to mate with the same partner year after year. These
              birds do occasionally choose a different mate if their partner
              dies or they cannot produce offspring.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> High Speeds</b> – Though these birds drift gracefully across
              the surface of lakes and ponds, they are more than capable of
              moving quickly. While they usually swim relatively slowly, they
              fly incredibly fast. In fact, some species can fly up to 60 miles
              per hour!
